# qOLS
Obstacle Limitation Surfaces Creation in accordance with Annex 14 Vol I and Vol II

# Key Constraints
- Single runway systems only at the moment, if you need more than one runway you will need to analyze separately.
- Projected Coordinate Systems used, no geodetic calculations. (Simplifies calculations)

# Roadmap
- Initial areas hard coded current OLS.
- Areas designed based on runway classification and values read from file based on ICAO standard values.
- Configuration of Areas for local conditions.
- Obstacle Evaluation.
- Automatic Report Creation.
- Future OLS concept introduced.
- FAA surfaces. Maybe?
